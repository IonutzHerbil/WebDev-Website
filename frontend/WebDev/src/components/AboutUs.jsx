        <h2>Club Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          The purpose of this club is to create a collaborative and educational environment where interested students can learn and develop practical skills in web development. The club will facilitate the accumulation of knowledge in technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, databases, and more, covering both front-end and back-end aspects, and even hardware elements.
        </p>
        <h3>Main Objectives:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Organizing workshops and brainstorming sessions.</li>
          <li>Collaborative projects.</li>
          <li>Inviting industry experts.</li>
          <li>Promoting continuous learning and collaboration.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Justification for the Request:</h3>
        <p>
          We believe that this club will make a significant contribution to the professional development of students, better preparing them for the job market and providing them with the opportunity to gain practical experience in a highly relevant field. Currently, we note the lack of such clubs that offer students the chance to specialize and develop essential practical skills for their future careers. We want to change this situation and provide our colleagues with valuable opportunities for learning and personal and professional development in a well-organized and structured environment.
        </p>
        <h3>Next Steps:</h3>
        <p>
          In order to establish the club, we respectfully ask you to approve this initiative and inform us of the necessary procedures for its officialization and promotion among students.
